1. Why VanillaJS? Because widgets should not include dependencies + it is fast + lightweight + also refreshed my knowledge of basics.
2. UI testing is hard and requires fiddling. So I skipped it for such a small task.
3. Tested only basic node logic, serialization and deserialization.
4. Work log: sth arond 10-11 hours, because of boilerplate.
5. If you want to style widget, there is custom css with million of hooks.
